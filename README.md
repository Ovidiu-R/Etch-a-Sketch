In this project I aim to create a customizable grid of cells upon a static-sized canvas that will react to the user's mouse movement by changing color while either being clicked or hovered over. Along the top of the page, there will be inputs that will allow the user to select the number of cells per side as well as background color, trail color and trail duration, which will be specified as a delay between the moment the mouse cursor moves off a cell to the moment the cell returns to its default color.
